# Stock League
This project is a stock simulator application that allows users to compete for points in a league. Users choose their team arbitrarily when they register along with 3 stocks. A user can currently only have 3 stocks for their profile. Points are calculated based on day to day change.

## Getting Started

You can refer to the link here to see the application deployed on Heroku: https://stockleague2.herokuapp.com/

If you want to download this repository and run locally, you will need a MySQL local database connection, and you can change the config.json file to the correct login. 

### Prerequisites

In order to start this program, you will need the following software downloaded: 
* [MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)


### Installing

In order to install node packages, simply open the terminal at the root and type:

```
npm install
```




### Running Locally

Open terminal at root and type:
```
node server
```
If your application is listening locally, it will be listening on port 3000. You can then view the application locally in the browser from this URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
